## Synopsis

Public service announcement for all programmers: **stop using `realpath()`**.
The C function `realpath(3)` included in C standard library on most Unix-like
operating systems, whatever equivalent there is for your programming language,
just don't use it in code in general[^scripts].

But why?

## Part I :: Where Did This Begin?

I stated down a rabbit hole of research on `realpath()` and its various
incarnations when I ran into a bizarre problem while working on my reimagined
[NixOS CLI utility](https://github.com/water-sucks/nixos). This is a rewrite of
various assorted scripts throughout the NixOS ecosystem in Zig[^rewrite], and
these scripts often relied on the usage of absolute paths in order to function.
I didn't question this until I found out that my invocations of
`std.fs.realpath()` were causing an instance of
[detectable illegal behavior](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.0/#toc-Illegal-Behavior)[^dib]
that only occurred in `ReleaseSafe` mode, but not in `Debug` mode during
development.

Interestingly, I have never been able to create a minimally reproducible example
of this since then; I assume it has been fixed in some fashion. However, that
doesn't mean that its usage is not harmful. In fact, Zig is strongly considering
outright [removing this function](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19353)
from its standard library[^inspiration]. So, let's research from what depths of
hell `realpath()` came from.

## Part II :: Abstraction Does Not Mean Portability

`realpath()` is not a portable construct in most places. The system `realpath()`
will have vastly different behavior depending on how the linked C library
implements it.

### `glibc` Implementation

Let's investigate how
[`glibc` implements it](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=stdlib/canonicalize.c;h=dca6fca5fb76cc51767364821c3ecf0ab534d725;hb=HEAD#l189).
This is the implementation details, slightly editorialized from the `glibc`
source code[^editorialized].

```cpp
// Return the canonical absolute name of file `name`.
//
// A canonical absolute name:
//   - Must be an absolute path.
//   - Cannot contain any "." nor ".." components
//   - Does not contain any repeated filename separators ("/") or symbolic
//     links (symlinks)
//   - All filename components must exist.
//
// Implementation details:
//   - If `resolved` is NULL, the result is malloc()'ed. Otherwise, if the
//     canonical name is PATH_MAX chars or more, return NULL with `errno` set
//     to ENAMETOOLONG.
//   - If the name fits in fewer than PATH_MAX chars, return the name in
//     `resolved`.
//   - If the name cannot be resolved and `resolved` is non-NULL, it contains the
//     name of the first component that cannot be resolved.
//   - If the name can be resolved, `resolved` holds the same value as the value
//     returned.

char* realpath(const char* name, char* resolved)
```

Already getting into quite a lot of platform-specific details. But hold on;
Linux has multiple `libc` implementations! What about those?

### `musl` Implementation

On the same system, we have `musl`. How does `musl` implement the same type of
functionality? The source code is
[here](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/misc/realpath.c#n14), but
this is the summary of the assumptions made and results returned:

```c
// Resolve a canonical name from a filename.
//
// A canonical absolute name:
//   - Must be an absolute path.
//   - Cannot contain any `"."` nor `".."` components
//   - Does not contain any repeated filename separators (`"/"`) or symbolic
//     links
//   - Not all filename components and ancestor directories need to exist; only
//     symlinks need to be resolved to existing places.

char* realpath(const char* restrict filename, char* restrict solved);
```

Do we see any differences here? Well, yeah! Apparently, two different `libc`
implementations on the SAME platform will determine if filename components exist
differently! So `realpath()` now doesn't have an invariant decreeing that
filenames need to exist if they can be resolved by `realpath()`. Great, now try
compiling the same application that relies on this supposed `glibc` "invariant"
for Alpine Linux, and watch as you get `"error: file not exists"` when your
application should have manually been ensuring their existence after resolution
anyway. Amazing! **_Not._** That is insanity that can only be resolved by a
night out drinking your sorrows away at 3:30 in the morning once you run into it
in a Docker container randomly.

### Other Language Standard Libraries

How do other languages do it then, you may ask? Often times in the WORST fucking
ways possible.

Take Zig. As new a language as it is, the way that it implements `realpath()` on
POSIX systems is just _insane_. Here's the
[source](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/ddcf6fcdf3452a4a7d55a27e7112e794447120b6/lib/std/os.zig#L104),
for reference, yet again.

I don't even want to give this the time of day, to be frank. It's genuinely that
bad. Here's a snippet from the relevant code, with portions omitted for brevity.

```zig
switch (native_os) {
    .windows => {
        var wide_buf: [windows.PATH_MAX_WIDE]u16 = undefined;
        const wide_slice = try windows.GetFinalPathNameByHandle(fd, .{}, wide_buf[0..]);
        const end_index = std.unicode.wtf16LeToWtf8(out_buffer, wide_slice);
        return out_buffer[0..end_index];
    },
    .macos, .ios, .watchos, .tvos, .visionos => {
        // On macOS, we can use F.GETPATH fcntl command to query the OS for
        // the path to the file descriptor.
        @memset(out_buffer[0..max_path_bytes], 0);
        switch (posix.errno(posix.system.fcntl(fd, posix.F.GETPATH, out_buffer))) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
        const len = mem.indexOfScalar(u8, out_buffer[0..], 0) orelse max_path_bytes;
        return out_buffer[0..len];
    },
    .linux, .serenity => {
        var procfs_buf: ["/proc/self/fd/-2147483648\x00".len]u8 = undefined;
        const proc_path = std.fmt.bufPrintZ(procfs_buf[0..], "/proc/self/fd/{d}", .{fd}) catch unreachable;
        const target = posix.readlinkZ(proc_path, out_buffer) catch |err| {
            // ...
        };
        return target;
    },
    .solaris, .illumos => {
        var procfs_buf: ["/proc/self/path/-2147483648\x00".len]u8 = undefined;
        const proc_path = std.fmt.bufPrintZ(procfs_buf[0..], "/proc/self/path/{d}", .{fd}) catch unreachable;
        const target = posix.readlinkZ(proc_path, out_buffer) catch |err| switch (err) {
            // ...
        };
        return target;
    },
    .freebsd => {
        var kfile: std.c.kinfo_file = undefined;
        kfile.structsize = std.c.KINFO_FILE_SIZE;
        switch (posix.errno(std.c.fcntl(fd, std.c.F.KINFO, @intFromPtr(&kfile)))) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...

    },
    .dragonfly => {
        switch (posix.errno(std.c.fcntl(fd, posix.F.GETPATH, out_buffer))) {
          // ...
        }
        // ...
    },
    .netbsd => {
        @memset(out_buffer[0..max_path_bytes], 0);
        switch (posix.errno(std.c.fcntl(fd, posix.F.GETPATH, out_buffer))) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    },
    else => unreachable,
}
```

Can you tell what's wrong? The TL;DR: it just gives up and **relies on extremely
platform-specific ways to retrieve an absolute file path given a file
descriptor** (`fd`).

_What the fuck???_ Who thought of this monstrosity? Apparently we just don't
care that file descriptors don't necessarily refer to paths on disk anymore.
Apparently shared memory and `pipe()` don't exist either. Jesus Christ. Indeed,
they recognize the error of their ways with the following comment:

> /// Calling this function is usually a bug.

Even _they_ know that this shit is stupid as hell! I mean, just look at the
implementation for Linux, SerenityOS, and Solaris. They construct a link to
`/proc/self` for the `fd` in question, and they evaluate the symlinks from
there. Genuinely disgusting, since it also doesn't necessarily take into account
higher process `ulimit` values for file descriptors that can overflow the
buffer. But oh well, who cares? I like my buffer overflows!

At least the other POSIX-compliant OSes use `fnctl()` macros properly, but that
will always depend on if the underlying OS `libc` will even expose these
operations. At least for those OSes, their `libc` is the only way to access
these types of things, so maybe it's a little more consistent, but hello??

So, here's the real question: **_why does `realpath()` even exist????_**

## Part III :: Rationale

There are two primary use cases that I can see for `realpath()` being a
potentially useful function, at least from looking around on Google at links
like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28992329/why-use-realpath):

1. To ensure the existence of a path and that it is resolvable (i.e. no symlink
   loops)
2. Displaying the full file path for a given relative path, for clarity in
   logging and/or displaying.
3. To prevent
   [path traversal attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal).
4. Your software relies on an assumption that the `cwd` is unreliable or can
   change in certain instances (i.e. going up directories to find the root of a
   Git repository or a Nix flake).

All of these are potentially useful, but also...they can be achieved in a
variety of ways that don't need to rely on the underlying operating system for
any assumptions or assumed invariants.

## Part IV :: What Should I Use, Then?

OK you big baby, you want `realpath()` and you're throwing a big fucking tantrum
about it. Cry harder.

But really, what should one use in place of `realpath()` then?

To be quite frank, `realpath()` usage can be avoided entirely in most instances.
How, you may ask? **Just maintain the reference to the filename in the first
place, first off**. If you are using a language like Zig or Python and are
trying to call `realpath()` on some sort of `Path`-like data structure, you had
to have been given a path to the file to call `realpath()` on it in these
instances. So, why don't you just use that reference? Don't even think about
reifying a filename given the file descriptor, or I will personally find your
address and annoy you to hell about it until you damn well stop. That filename
will have enough context for you to construct the real path to the file in a
manual fashion, if you so please.

As far as I can tell from reading standard library code from various other
languages (including the prior `libc` examples), the general way to look for
canonical paths on _any_ given system given some path is to do the following
steps:

1. Resolve any `..` and `.` links.
2. Evaluate any symlinks (and resolve their `.` and `..` references as well) if
   needed.
3. Continue doing this until a file path that is not a symlink is reached (it
   may not necessarily exist, do not assume this is the case ever).
4. Append the current `cwd` to the path if relative, or leave it alone if it is
   absolute.

This approach is much more portable. You can use a stack to resolve `.` and `..`
references and checking for the presence of a prefixed `..` after to prevent
said path traversal attacks can absolve the usage of `realpath()` entirely in
most cases. This is especially true when the `cwd` of a process doesn't need to
change at all.

Who will write this code, you may ask?

_You_. You're smart. You can write this cross-platform path resolution code on
your own if you need it. Needing to assume absolute paths is a fairly uncommon
scenario, and to be frank, IMO it should not be a standard library function in
general because people will end up reaching for it and run into these
OS-specific footguns. `realpath()` itself is more of an operating
system-specific construct, and should be treated as such.

I would write this code for an example, but to be honest, I'm lazy. And I also
try _not_ to rely on `realpath()`-like functionality anymore, and just enforce
absolute paths whenever I need them, and manually evaluate symlinks if needed.
Go has a nice, deterministic `EvalSymlinks()` function that does this, so that's
what I've been resorting to in most of my Go code, and equivalent functions
elsewhere. Farewell, `realpath()`. Rot in hell.

[^scripts]:
    I am not quite sure about usage of the `realpath` command in shell scripts.
    Since shell scripts usually tend to not be as cross-platform as programs
    written in more general-purpose programming languages, I've found that usage
    of the `realpath` command can be quite useful when running commands ad-hoc.
    But I'll come back to this later and add an extra section about it if I
    change my mind.

[^rewrite]:
    I'm rewriting this in Go for many reasons. I'll probably end up writing a
    blog post about this too.

[^dib]:
    "Detectable illegal behavior" is not quite the term that the Zig community
    or documentation has solidified on yet, but there is a good amount of
    discussion on it in a
    [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2402).

[^inspiration]:
    Thanks to [@matklad](https://github.com/matklad) on the linked GitHub issue
    for providing the inspiration for really writing a post on this topic in
    this
    [comment](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19353#issuecomment-2006795388).

[^editorialized]:
    Well, I kinda just took a comment from the source code and I reworded it to
    make more sense.
