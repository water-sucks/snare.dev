## Prologue: Assemble, NeoVimmers!

Hail, all ye that can see and hear! The **NeoLORD**[^neolord] hath spoken to me
upon **Mount Joy**[^mountjoy], and hath given me instructions for all to follow,
lest they be slaughtered by proprietors and condemned forever to the unfree
software of their fellow slaves' toils. The future does not need us[^thefuture];
let us heed these commands written upon this buffer and treat our present days
with the dignity they deserve.

## The Zen Commandments

Thus saith the **NeoLORD**:

1. Thou shalt abide by the philosophy of my right hand[^unix]: "Thou shalt do
   one thing, and do it well." The `$EDITOR` is a craft, created to create. It
   is the crafter of crafters. Do not fall into the traps of the curs√®d devil
   which shall not be named, and do more than is intended. I am the **NeoLORD**.
2. Thou shalt not use editors other than the venerable Neovim; for I the
   **NeoLORD** am a jealous God, and will destroy all that create with no regard
   to their true creator. I am the **NeoLORD**.
3. Thou shalt abstain from usage of VimScript in favor of Lua. The venerable
   VimScript will be kept alive, since he is still useful, but beware; old
   wineskins will break eventually. I am the **NeoLORD**.
4. Thou shalt make the fullest use of the tools that the **NeoLORD** has
   graciously provided to you. Give LSP and Treesitter their due homage. I am
   the **NeoLORD**.
5. Honor plugin maintainers with the utmost respect. They are not subject to
   your fleeting whims, and are free to do as they please with the fruits of
   their labor. Must a conflict arise, thou shalt resolve thy disagreements
   through civil discussion. Take care, and wield the mighty fork[^fork] with
   caution. I am the **NeoLORD**.
6. Beware the temptresses of useless plugins. Do not let them sour your desire
   to create. I am the **NeoLORD**.
7. Thou shalt respect Vim and its contributions to the world, and upstream any
   applicable patches, for the spirit of Bram shall live forever and ever. I am
   the **NeoLORD**.
8. Thou shalt not act in sloth, lest you perish in the bottomless pits of the
   lazy Inferno[^inferno]. The **NeoLORD** your God is not a lazy[^lazy]God;
   thou shalt instead weave thy configurations by hand. For the lazy folk are
   unable to partake in the **NeoLORD's** wisdom, and their fingers will rot
   from confusion. I am the **NeoLORD**.
9. Thou shalt not blaspheme against the spirit of modality, for whoever disowns
   the other modes in favor of insert-only mode shall never be forgiven until
   they repent of their ways.
10. Do not distress over the transgressions of the ignorant, for everyone is a
    sinner in the **NeoLORD's** presence. Instead, lead them towards repentance
    and the narrow gate of _change_. I am the **NeoLORD**.

## The Simpleton's Zen Commandments

To all Neovim programmers: follow these commands.

1. Do one thing, and do it well. Don't be like Emacs.
2. Don't use editors other than Neovim, or else.
3. Use Lua rather than VimScript.
4. Use the native LSP and Treesitter functionality.
5. Don't be an asshole to plugin maintainers. If you don't like what they're
   doing, or they don't do what you want, fork the damn thing and do it yourself
   if you must.
6. Don't add more plugins than you need to. It's easy to fall into config hell.
7. Upstream any patches that are in Neovim core to Vim if possible. Both editors
   are great. One is just better.
8. Don't use Neovim distributions like LazyVim if you want to learn Neovim
   functionality properly. Make your configurations yourself.
9. Use the modes to your advantage! Normal mode and visual mode are much more
   powerful than you give them credit for.
10. Lots of people don't use Neovim. It's fine, you didn't know what Neovim was
    for a while either. Spread the good news and tell them to use it too!

## Epilogue

This is just a joke that my friends and I wrote in a Discord voice call. Don't
take it too seriously.

co-authoring some of these commandments with me.

[send me a message](https://snare.dev/about)! I'd love to hear more ideas for
niche, satirical content. Maybe the **NeoLORD's** commission is in need of
writing.

[^neolord]:
    The _NeoLORD_ is T.J. DeVries (aka Teej). Teej, if you're reading this, I
    don't know why my friends and I made you the **NeoLORD**. But you were the
    funniest to reference.

[^mountjoy]: A reference to Bill Joy, the creator of `vi`.
[^thefuture]:
    A reference to
    [The Future Does Not Need Us](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/computing/nano/documents/Joy%20-%20Why%20the%20Future%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Us.pdf),
    a publication, also authored by Bill Joy.

[^unix]: The [UNIX Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
[^fork]:
    Forking plugins and/or maintaining patches for the same plugins is a good
    idea when you're in complete disagreement with a maintainer over something
    large and highly technical. Neovim itself is a fork of Vim, so they can be
    successful in practice. But just wield caution when doing so.

[^inferno]:
    Dante's _Divine Comedy_. Yes, the hell references are definitely good for
    this.

[^lazy]: This refers to Neovim distributions such as LazyVim.
