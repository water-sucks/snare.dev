  <blockquote class="subtitle-quote">The Treasure Trove</blockquote>
  <p>
    These are my musings, my reflections on life. I love philosophy, and seek to
    understand the world, as complex as it can be. I also do some technical
    writing on things that I find interesting when I program. At times, I'll
    also write on some personal subjects, kinda like a diary. I may not be a
    particularly good writer, but frankly, I could care less. If you don't want
    to read, you can always click off the page, I don't mind at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also some fun, random content for those that are stuck in this cycle of
    seeking knowledge and/or humor (terrible, at that).
