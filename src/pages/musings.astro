  <p>
    These are my musings, my reflections on life. I love philosophy, and seek to
    understand the world in all of its idiosyncrasies. At times, I'll also write
    on some rather personal subjects. I may not be a particularly good writer,
    but frankly, I could care less. If you don't want to read, you can always
    click off the page, I don't mind at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also some fun, random content for those that are stuck in this cycle of
    seeking knowledge.
