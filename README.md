<h6 align="center">My personal website.</h6>

This is where you can know a little bit about who I am (yes, I am a real person!
I know, pretty wild). I also write about random stuff here, so come by and check
it out sometimes, or subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://snare.dev/rss.xml) to
stay up-to-date. Have fun!

The official source code is located on
[sr.ht](https://sr.ht/~watersucks/snare.dev); a
[GitHub mirror](https://github.com/water-sucks/) also exists.

Prefer sending patches to the [mailing list](~watersucks/snare.dev@lists.sr.ht)
if you see any mistakes on the website and if you would like to fix them.

Thanks to [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for
being the best and giving me the tooling needed for building this website.
