This is where you can know a little bit about who I am (yes, I am a real person!
I know, pretty wild). I also write about random stuff here, so come by and check
it out sometimes, or subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://snare.dev/rss.xml) to
stay up-to-date. Have fun reading this!

Thanks to [Astro](https://astro.build) for being the best and giving me the
tooling needed for building this website.
